# file.io uploader
Sometimes you're just in a CLI environment and want to upload to an ephemeral file sharing service to download elsewhere real quick. You don't want to open a browser, that messes with your workflow right?

Well that's why I made this, use with `npx` to upload a file to https://file.io.

## Usage
`npx file-io-upload <file>`
